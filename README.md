# Building-a-neural-network-from-Scratch
This project showcases a neural network built entirely from scratch using only mathematical principles and Python. No TensorFlow, no PyTorchâ€”just pure math and code. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in digit classification using the MNIST dataset while deepening the understanding of neural networks' underlying mechanics.
